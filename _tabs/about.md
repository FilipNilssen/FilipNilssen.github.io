## Hi there!ðŸ‘‹

I'm Filip, a student at OsloMet currently in my final year of studying for a Master's in [Cybersecurity](https://www.oslomet.no/en/study/tkd/cyber-security). I already have a Bachelor in Information Technology â€“ also from OsloMet â€“ and I'm very fascinated by technology and software. ðŸ’»


I created this portfolio page to have a main area to navigate through my personal projects and programs, but you are certainly free to snoop around! ðŸ”Ž
